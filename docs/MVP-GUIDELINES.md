# TKA Scribe MVP Guidelines

> **Target Release**: This week
> **Last Updated**: 2024-12-31
> **Version**: 0.8.0 (MVP)

---

## Executive Summary

The MVP enables users to **create, save, navigate, and share sequences** in animation, image, or video form. This document defines what's in scope, what's out, critical blockers, and the testing checklist.

---

## 1. MVP Scope Definition

### What Regular Users See

| Module | Status | Tabs/Features |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Dashboard** | ✅ In MVP | Landing page, navigation hub |
| **Create** | ✅ In MVP | Assemble, Construct, Generate (no Spell) |
| **Discover** | ✅ In MVP | Gallery, Collections, Creators |
| **Premium** | ✅ In MVP | Upsell page for non-premium users |

### What's Hidden from Regular Users (Admin/Tester Only)

| Module | Role Required | Reason |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Learn | Admin | Not production ready |
| Compose | Admin | Advanced animation editing |
| Train | Admin | Prop detection training |
| Library | Admin | Being prepared for next release |
| Feedback | Tester+ | Internal feedback system |
| ML Training | Tester | Data collection tool |
| Admin | Admin | System management |
| 3D Viewer | Admin | Experimental |
| Word Card | Admin | Internal tool |
| Write | Admin | Internal tool |
| Spell Tab | Admin | Create tab not ready for users |

---

## 2. Core User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create a Sequence

```
User opens Create → Picks method (Assemble/Construct/Generate) → Builds sequence → Sequence appears in workspace
```

**Entry Points:**
- Dashboard → Create module
- Bottom nav (mobile) / Sidebar (desktop)

**Methods Available:**
1. **Assemble** - Beginner-friendly, 6 choices per hand, step-by-step
2. **Construct** - Full option picker, step-by-step beat building
3. **Generate** - Parameter-based auto-generation (length, level, LOOP type)

**Exit Criteria:**
- User has a visible sequence in the workspace
- Beat grid shows all created beats
- Undo/redo works

---

### Workflow 2: Save a Sequence

```
User creates sequence → Clicks Save → Enters metadata → Sequence saved to library
```

**Current State:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Component exists, trigger button missing

**Required Fix:**
- Add "Save to Library" button to ButtonPanel
- Wire button to `panelState.openSaveToLibraryPanel()`

**Save Panel Features:**
- Name input (auto-populated from display word)
- Visibility toggle (public/private)
- Tags input
- Notes field
- Progress indicator (5-step save)

---

### Workflow 3: Navigate Through Beats

```
User views sequence → Taps/clicks beats → Selected beat highlighted → Can scroll through long sequences
```

**Current State:** ✅ WORKING

**Features:**
- Beat grid with tap-to-select
- Scroll state managed
- Selected beat visually highlighted
- Animation preview available

---

### Workflow 4: Share a Sequence

```
User creates sequence → Opens Share Hub → Selects format → Exports/shares
```

**Current State:** ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS

**What Works:**
- Share Hub drawer opens
- Format selection UI (Animation/Static/Performance)
- Settings panels render

**What's Broken:**
- Sequence data not syncing to Share Hub (infinite loop bug)
- Export callback not implemented in Create module
- Performance video completely unimplemented

**MVP Scope for Share:**
| Format | MVP Status | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Static Image (PNG) | ✅ Fix & ship | Core requirement |
| Animation (MP4) | ⚠️ Stretch | If time permits |
| Performance Video | ❌ Cut | Remove from UI or mark "Coming Soon" |
| Composite | ❌ Cut | Remove from MVP |

---

## 3. Critical Blockers

### P0 - Must Fix Before Release

| Issue | Location | Impact | Effort |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Save button missing** | `ButtonPanel.svelte` | Users can't save sequences | 10 min |
| **Share Hub sequence sync** | `ShareHubPanel.svelte:53-69` | Share Hub has no data to export | 30 min |
| **Static image export** | `SingleMediaView.svelte` | No actual export happens | 2 hrs |
| **Performance video removal** | `ShareHubPanel.svelte` | Shows broken feature | 15 min |

### P1 - Should Fix Before Release

| Issue | Location | Impact | Effort |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Console.logs in DiscoverFilter | `DiscoverFilter.ts:217-278` | Debug noise in production | 5 min |
| Edit button discoverability | `ButtonPanel.svelte` | Users don't know editing exists | 15 min |
| Filter result count | `HybridFilterPanel.svelte` | Users can't see filter impact | 30 min |

### P2 - Nice to Have

| Issue | Location | Impact | Effort |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Animation MP4 export | Compose services | Full share workflow | 4 hrs |
| Sort direction in service | `DiscoverSorter.ts` | Clean architecture | 30 min |
| Favorites toggle toast | `SequenceCard.svelte` | User feedback | 15 min |

---

## 4. Module-by-Module Status

### CREATE Module: ✅ MVP Ready

| Tab | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Assemble | ✅ Ready | Beginner-friendly, step-by-step |
| Construct | ✅ Ready | Full option picker working |
| Generate | ✅ Ready | All parameters functional |
| Spell | ❌ Hidden | Admin-only, not ready |

**Post-Creation Features:**
| Feature | Status | Fix Required |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Sequence Actions Panel | ✅ Working | Improve button visibility |
| Save to Library | ⚠️ Hidden | Add trigger button |
| Undo/Redo | ✅ Working | Tab-scoped |
| Animation Preview | ✅ Working | Play button in toolbar |

---

### DISCOVER Module: ✅ MVP Ready

| Tab | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Gallery | ✅ Ready | Virtualized, responsive |
| Collections | ✅ Ready | Curated playlists |
| Creators | ✅ Ready | Community profiles |

**Features:**
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Sequence Cards | ✅ Ready | Prop-aware thumbnails |
| Filtering (8 types) | ✅ Ready | Remove console.logs |
| Sorting | ✅ Ready | Direction logic manual but works |
| Mobile Immersive | ✅ Ready | Full-screen detail view |
| Desktop Side Panel | ✅ Ready | 35% width detail panel |
| Favorites | ✅ Ready | Consider adding toast |

---

### SHARE Functionality: ⚠️ Needs Work

| Format | Status | MVP Decision |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Static PNG | ⚠️ Broken | **Must fix** |
| Animation MP4 | ⚠️ Partial | Stretch goal |
| Performance Video | ❌ Broken | **Cut from MVP** |
| Composite | ❌ Stub | **Cut from MVP** |

**Critical Path:**
1. Fix sequence sync bug in ShareHubPanel
2. Implement static image export callback
3. Hide/disable Performance and Composite modes
4. Add loading/error states

---

## 5. User Roles & Access

### Regular User (MVP Target)
- Dashboard, Create (3 tabs), Discover (3 tabs)
- PNG export (when fixed)
- Social sharing via Web Share API

### Premium User
- Same as regular + advanced filters

### Tester
- Same as premium + Feedback module + video/GIF export

### Admin
- Everything visible for testing

---

## 7. Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Gallery load (50 sequences) | < 2s | ✅ OK |
| Sequence generation | < 1s | ✅ OK |
| Option picker scroll | 60fps | ✅ OK |
| Share Hub open | < 500ms | ⚠️ Untested |
| Image export | < 5s | ⚠️ Untested |

---

## 8. Known Limitations (Ship Anyway)

These issues are acceptable for MVP:

1. **No multi-select filters** - Can only filter by one criteria at a time
2. **Manual sort direction** - Code reverses array instead of service
3. **No sequence import** - Users can't import from file (tester-only)
4. **No delete from Discover** - Stub only, not implemented
5. **Tablet breakpoint unclear** - May show desktop UI on smaller tablets
6. **No offline support** - Requires network connection
