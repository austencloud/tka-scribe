# Release Command

Automate the release process by analyzing completed feedback, generating version numbers, creating git tags, and archiving completed feedback.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather ALL Changes (Feedback + Git Commits)

**CRITICAL**: Always gather BOTH sources of changes. Not everything goes through the feedback system, so you must check both to get a comprehensive picture.

**Step 1a: Run the release script preview**

```bash
node scripts/release.js --dry-run
```

This will show completed feedback items from Firestore.

**Step 1b: Get git commits since last release**

```bash
git log v{LAST_VERSION}..HEAD --oneline --no-merges
```

Replace `{LAST_VERSION}` with the most recent tag (shown in the dry-run output).

**Step 1c: Get detailed feedback (if any)**

```bash
node scripts/fetch-feedback.js list --status completed
```

**Why both sources?**

- Feedback captures user-reported issues and feature requests
- Git commits capture developer-initiated fixes, refactors, and infrastructure work
- Some work bypasses the feedback system entirely (CSP fixes, build config, etc.)
- The changelog should reflect ALL meaningful changes, not just tracked feedback

**Combine the information:**

Review both the feedback items AND the commit messages to build a complete picture of what changed. Look for:

- Commits that aren't represented in feedback (infrastructure, build, security)
- Feedback items that might have multiple related commits
- Duplicate entries (same fix mentioned in both)

### Step 2: Rewrite Changelog for Users

**CRITICAL**: The raw feedback titles are developer notes, NOT user-facing release notes. Before showing the preview, you MUST rewrite them.

**Audience**: Flow artists who create choreography. They don't code, don't know what "persistence" or "endpoints" mean, and just want to know what's better for them.

**Rewriting Rules**:

1. **Remove developer jargon**: No "persistence", "endpoints", "state", "components", "services"
2. **Focus on user benefit**: What can they DO now? What problem is fixed?
3. **Be specific about WHAT changed**: Don't just say "better" or "improved" - describe the actual change
4. **Ideal length: 8-15 words**: Long enough to be clear, short enough to scan
5. **Use active voice**: "You can now..." or "Fixed..."
6. **Name the feature/area**: Users need context - "in the option picker", "when exporting", etc.
7. **Avoid vague words**: "better", "improved", "enhanced", "updated" alone aren't helpful

**BAD vs GOOD Examples**:
| ❌ Too Vague | ✅ Specific |
|-------------|------------|
| "Better option picker" | "Option picker now shows your filter choices immediately" |
| "Improved drawer animations" | "Drawers slide open/closed more smoothly with less lag" |
| "Cleaner visuals" | "Props and arrows now render without visible outlines" |
| "App security improvements" | "Added security headers for safer browsing" |
| "Enhanced settings" | "Settings now include a Preferences tab for theme and display options" |

**Transform Examples**:
| Raw Feedback Title | User-Friendly Version |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "Fixed i thought we had implemented persistence for the feedback..." | "Your feedback drafts now save automatically between sessions" |
| "Added when extending a module in the desktop navigation sidebar..." | "Clicking a module in the sidebar now expands its sections smoothly" |
| "Fixed generator endpoint mismatch" | "Sequence generator now creates the correct number of beats" |
| "Added video collaboration (Instagram-style)" | "Share videos with collaborators using Instagram-style mentions" |
| "Fixed toggle cards don't register taps with slight finger movement" | "Toggle buttons now respond even when your finger moves slightly while tapping" |

**After rewriting**, present the polished changelog to the user for review before proceeding.

### Step 3: Show Preview to User

Present a comprehensive preview that includes:

**Sources gathered:**
- Completed feedback count and breakdown (X bugs, Y features, Z general)
- Git commits since last release (N commits)

**Version info:**
- Current version vs. suggested new version
- Bump rationale (minor for features, patch for fixes only)

**Combined changelog preview:**
- **YOUR REWRITTEN changelog** (categorized by fixed/added/improved)
- Include items from BOTH feedback AND commits
- Deduplicate where the same change appears in both sources
- Infrastructure/build changes from commits that weren't in feedback

**Warnings:**
- Git status warnings (if uncommitted changes exist)

### Step 4: Get User Confirmation

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm the release:

**Question:** "Ready to release v{VERSION}?"

**Header:** "Release"

**Options:**

1. **"Yes, release now"**
   - Description: "Update package.json, create git commit & tag, GitHub release, archive feedback"

2. **"Change version number"**
   - Description: "Manually specify a different version (e.g., for major releases)"

3. **"Edit changelog"**
   - Description: "Revise the release notes before publishing"

4. **"Cancel"**
   - Description: "Abort the release process"

### Step 5: Handle User Response

#### If "Yes, release now":

**IMPORTANT**: You must pass your rewritten changelog entries to the release script. Create a temporary JSON file with your polished entries:

```bash
# Write your rewritten changelog to a temp file
cat > .release-changelog.json << 'EOF'
[
  { "category": "fixed", "text": "Your polished fix description" },
  { "category": "added", "text": "Your polished feature description" },
  { "category": "improved", "text": "Your polished improvement description" }
]
EOF

# Execute release with the custom changelog
node scripts/release.js --confirm --changelog .release-changelog.json
```

This will:

- Update package.json version field
- Create git commit with changelog
- Create annotated git tag
- Create GitHub release with **YOUR REWRITTEN** changelog
- Archive completed feedback in Firestore (feedback mode only)
- Create version record in Firestore with **YOUR REWRITTEN** changelog entries
- **Create a "What's New" announcement** that pops up for all users

Then proceed to Step 6.

**Note:** The announcement summarizes key features and links to Settings → What's New for full details. Use `--skip-announcement` if you don't want to notify users.

#### If "Edit changelog":

Let the user provide corrections, then update your rewritten changelog and return to Step 4.

#### If "Change version number":

Ask for manual version input, then execute with:

```bash
node scripts/release.js --version {USER_VERSION} --confirm
```

Validate the version format (semver) before proceeding.

#### If "Cancel":

Exit gracefully with message: "Release cancelled. No changes made."

### Step 5: Ask About Pushing to Remote

After successful release, use AskUserQuestion again:

**Question:** "Release v{VERSION} created successfully! Push to remote?"

**Header:** "Push"

**Options:**

1. **"Yes, push tags and commits"**
   - Description: "Push the release commit and tag to origin"

2. **"No, I'll push manually"**
   - Description: "Keep changes local for now"

#### If "Yes, push tags and commits":

```bash
git push && git push --tags
```

Show output and confirm success.

#### If "No, I'll push manually":

Show reminder:

```
✓ Release v{VERSION} committed locally.
  To push later: git push && git push --tags
```

## Version Bumping Rules

The release script automatically suggests a version based on changelog content:

**Feedback Mode:**

- **Minor bump** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): At least one `feature` type feedback item
- **Patch bump** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Only `bug` or `general` type feedback items

**Git History Mode:**

- **Minor bump** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): At least one `feat:` commit
- **Patch bump** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Only `fix:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, or `chore:` commits

**Both Modes:**

- **Manual override**: User can specify any semver version with `--version` flag

## Important Notes

- NEVER run with `--confirm` without user approval via AskUserQuestion
- ALWAYS run `--dry-run` first to preview
- ALWAYS show the full output to the user before confirming
- NEVER push without explicit user confirmation
- If git status is dirty, the script will warn - ask user if they want to continue
- The release script handles all Firestore operations (archives feedback, creates version record)

## Error Handling

The release script will exit with error if:

- No completed feedback AND no commits since last tag → explain options
- Version format invalid → show semver examples
- Firestore operation fails (feedback mode only) → error message with details
- Git operation fails → error message with details

If any step fails after confirmation:

- Git operations are atomic (commit + tag together)
- If Firestore fails after git operations (feedback mode), user must manually clean up
- Show clear error message with recovery steps

- Commits revealed a security fix not tracked in feedback
- Changelog was rewritten in user-friendly language
- Combined sources give complete picture of changes

## Backfilling GitHub Releases

If you have existing git tags without GitHub releases, use the backfill script:

```bash
node scripts/temp/backfill-github-releases.js
```

This will:

- Check all git tags in the repository
- Compare against existing GitHub releases
- For each tag without a release:
  - Pull changelog from Firestore version record (if available)
  - Fallback to git tag message if no version record exists
  - Create a formatted GitHub release

The script is idempotent - safe to run multiple times.
