# 🚨 CRITICAL: ESLint patterns don't support leading / like git does.
# We need to be explicit: ignore build/ at root but NOT src/lib/modules/build/
# Using just "build/" can match any directory named build at any depth.
# Solution: Be specific or accept that we might lint the build output (which gets cleaned anyway).
