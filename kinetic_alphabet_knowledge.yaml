  polyrhythmic_relevance:
    description: |
      In polyrhythmic LOOPs like the 3:4 DΣPMYDJθMPWJ example:
      - Beat pairs often follow alpha_beta_counterpart patterns
      - D↔J and Σ↔θ relationships repeat at the polyrhythmic interval
      - Motion types (pro/anti) may follow Period 3
      - Spatial positions (section transitions) may follow Period 4

# LOOPs (Continuous Assembly Patterns)
# Sequences that return to their starting position through specific transformations
caps:
  definition: |
    A LOOP is a circular sequence - one that returns to its starting position.
    LOOPs are classified by which transformation(s) bring the sequence home.
    A single sequence may satisfy multiple transformation paths (OR relationship).

  # The 5 base components that can combine to form LOOP types
  base_components:
    rotated:
      description: "Positions rotate around the grid to return home"
      key_insight: |
        Rotated means COMPLETING the full rotation, not just reaching a rotated midpoint.
        The second half must CONTINUE rotating in the same direction to return home.
      variants:
        halved:
          slice_size: "180°"
          pattern: "Two halves, each rotates 180°, completing 360° total"
          mental_model: |
            Like a clock hand moving continuously:
            - Starts at 12 o'clock (0°)
            - First half reaches 6 o'clock (180°)
            - Second half CONTINUES to 12 o'clock (360°)
            NOT: going 0°→180° then reversing back 180°→0° (that's Rewound)
        quartered:
          slice_size: "90°"
          pattern: "Four quarters, each rotates 90°, completing 360° total"
          mental_model: "Clock hand: 12→3→6→9→12 (continuing same direction)"

    mirrored:
      description: "Positions mirror vertically to return home"
      axis: "Vertical axis through center"
      effect: "Left-right positions swap across the vertical midline"

    flipped:
      description: "Positions mirror horizontally to return home"
      axis: "Horizontal axis through center"
      effect: "Top-bottom positions swap across the horizontal midline"
      note: "Same concept as mirrored but along perpendicular axis"

    swapped:
      description: "Blue and Red hands swap roles"
      effect: "What blue hand did, red hand now does (and vice versa)"
      note: "Changes body motion significantly"

    inverted:
      description: "Motion types flip between PRO and ANTI"
      effect: "Prospin becomes antispin, antispin becomes prospin"

    rewound:
      description: "Second half plays in reverse - hands trace back"
      key_insight: |
        The hands retrace their path backwards to return home.
        Like pressing rewind on a video.
      distinction_from_rotated: |
        Rewound: Hands reverse direction to go back
        Rotated: Hands continue same rotational direction forward

      note: |
        NOT rotated - although positions at beat 2 are 180° from start,
        the return happens via rewinding/mirroring, not continued rotation.

  # Freeform sequences

  full_reversal:
    description: "Both prop and hand retrace paths"
    notation: "R/R indicates prop reversal component"
    effect: "Return to previous position like going backwards in time"

# Execution Notes

  negative_space:

    benefit: "Face audience, reduce body movement"

  body_turns:

    benefit: "Add movement, handle longer staves"

  thumb_orientation:
    importance: "Track rotations and check position on every beat"
    variations: ["thumbs in", "thumbs out", "mixed"]

  finger_spinning:
    recommendation: "Avoid - use negative space and body turns instead"
    reason: "Maintains precision and tracking ability"
