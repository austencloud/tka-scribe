/**
 * Start Position Domain Model
 *
 * Represents the initial prop configuration before a sequence begins.
 *
 * Start positions are NOT beats - they don't have:
 * - Duration (user holds position indefinitely until starting sequence)
 * - Beat numbers (not part of the sequence progression)
 * - Reversals (no motion means no reversal)
 * - Motion/arrows (props are stationary)
 *
 * Start positions only show WHERE and HOW props are held initially.
