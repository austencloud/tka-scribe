/**
 * Mirrored Rotated Inverted Swapped CAP Executor
 *
 * Executes the mirrored-rotated-inverted-swapped CAP (Circular Arrangement Pattern) by composing
 * FOUR CAP operations sequentially:
 * 1. ROTATED: Apply strict rotation with user-selected slice size (halved or quartered)
 * 2. MIRRORED + SWAPPED + INVERTED: Apply all three transformations together
 *    - MIRRORED: Mirror locations vertically
 *    - SWAPPED: Blue does what Red did, Red does what Blue did
 *    - INVERTED: Flip letters (A↔B), flip motion types (PRO↔ANTI)
 *    - **Rotation Direction**: PRESERVED (all three transformations together keep rotation the same)
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * HALVED mode (16-count sequence):
 * - Generate 4 letters (16 ÷ 4)
 * - Rotation (halved) → 8 letters (4 × 2, returns to home)
 * - Mirrored+Swapped+Inverted → 16 letters (8 × 2, with all transformations)
 *
 * QUARTERED mode (16-count sequence):
 * - Generate 2 letters (16 ÷ 8)
 * - Rotation (quartered) → 8 letters (2 × 4, returns to home)
 * - Mirrored+Swapped+Inverted → 16 letters (8 × 2, with all transformations)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Supports both halved and quartered slice sizes
 * IMPORTANT: End position for generation must match the rotation requirement
 * IMPORTANT: After rotation, sequence returns to home, which is valid for mirrored-swapped-inverted
