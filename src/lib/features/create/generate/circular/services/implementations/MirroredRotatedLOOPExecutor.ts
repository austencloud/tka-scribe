/**
 * Mirrored Rotated LOOP Executor
 *
 * Executes the mirrored-rotated LOOP (Continuous Assembly Pattern) by composing
 * two LOOP operations sequentially:
 * 1. ROTATED: Apply strict rotation with user-selected slice size (halved or quartered)
 * 2. MIRRORED: Apply vertical mirroring to double the sequence again
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * HALVED mode (16-count sequence):
 * - Generate 4 letters (16 ÷ 4)
 * - Rotation (halved) → 8 letters (4 × 2, returns to home)
 * - Mirroring → 16 letters (8 × 2)
 *
 * QUARTERED mode (16-count sequence):
 * - Generate 2 letters (16 ÷ 8)
 * - Rotation (quartered) → 8 letters (2 × 4, returns to home)
 * - Mirroring → 16 letters (8 × 2)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Supports both halved and quartered slice sizes
 * IMPORTANT: End position for generation must match the rotation requirement
