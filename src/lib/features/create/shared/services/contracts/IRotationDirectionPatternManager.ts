/**
 * Rotation Direction Pattern Service Contract
 *
 * Service for managing rotation direction patterns - extracting them from sequences,
 * saving/loading from Firebase, and applying them to transform sequences.
 *
 * Key difference from Turn Pattern Service:
 * - Turn patterns modify the NUMBER of turns (0, 1, 2, fl, etc.)
 * - Rotation direction patterns modify the DIRECTION of rotation (CW vs CCW)
 * - This service NEVER adds or removes turns - only changes direction where rotation exists
 *
 * Skip Logic (when applying):
 * - FLOAT → skip (floats have no rotation)
 * - STATIC @ 0 turns → skip (no rotation to modify)
 * - DASH @ 0 turns → skip (don't add turns)
 * - DASH @ turns > 0 + "none" → skip (don't remove turns)
 * - PRO/ANTI + "none" → skip (don't convert to static/dash)
