      "Right angle (90°)",
      "Adjacent points",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Alpha position has hands on opposite sides of the grid (180° apart), like N-S or E-W.",

    question: "What makes letters connect in a TKA word?",
    options: [
      "Letters must be alphabetical",
      "End position of one letter = Start of next",
      "All letters must be the same",
      "Letters must alternate motion types",

    explanation:
      "A LOOP is a word where the final position returns to the original starting position, creating a loop.",

    letters: [SAMPLE_LETTERS.A],
    options: ["Antispin", "Prospin", "Hybrid", "Static"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Letter A uses Prospin motion for both hands - they rotate in the same direction as their travel.",
