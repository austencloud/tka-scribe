/**
 * InversifyJS Service Type Identifiers - Unified Export
 *
 * This file aggregates all domain-specific type identifiers into a single TYPES object
 * for backward compatibility while allowing domain-specific imports for better organization.
 *
 * ## Architecture Decision: Why This Structure Exists
 *
 * This is NOT the "Service Locator anti-pattern" - it's an intentional adaptation of
 * InversifyJS for Svelte 5's component model. Here's why:
 *
 * ### The Svelte 5 Constraint
 * Svelte components are NOT classes you instantiate - the framework creates them.
 * This means traditional constructor injection is impossible for components.
 * Your options are:
 *
 * 1. `resolve(TYPES.X)` - Global service locator (what we use)
 * 2. `getContext('service')` - Svelte's built-in pattern (component-tree-scoped locator)
 * 3. Props drilling - Doesn't scale
 * 4. Module singletons - No interface abstraction
 *
 * Options 1 and 2 are structurally identical patterns - the difference is scope.
 * We chose option 1 because:
 * - Services need to be shared across component trees
 * - HMR requires container persistence across hot reloads
 * - Inversify provides proper constructor injection for service-to-service dependencies
 *
 * ### What Inversify Actually Provides
 * For SERVICE-TO-SERVICE dependencies, Inversify uses proper constructor injection
 * via `@inject()` decorators. The "service locator" aspect only exists at the
 * component boundary where Svelte takes over.
 *
 * ### Why the Token Registry is Large
 * Each domain (animation, rendering, generation, etc.) has its own services.
 * The alternative would be tightly coupling components to concrete implementations.
 * The size reflects the application's feature set, not architectural debt.
 *
 * @see docs/architecture/DI-ARCHITECTURE.md for detailed rationale
