/**
 * Firebase Video Upload Service
 *
 * Purpose: Upload user performance videos and animated sequences to Firebase Storage.
 * Handles:
 * - Uploading performance videos from user's device to Firebase Storage
 * - Uploading animated WebP/GIF sequences generated from notation data
 * - Managing storage paths: users/{userId}/recordings|animations/{sequenceId}/
 * - Progress callbacks for upload UI
 * - Cleanup of orphaned files
 *
 * Why Firebase Storage:
 * - Already using Firebase/Firestore
 * - Cost-effective for video hosting (~$0.026/GB/month)
 * - Integrates with Firestore security rules
 * - CDN built-in
 *
 * Integration points:
 * - Call from SequencePersistenceService when user saves sequence
 * - Call from Share flow before exporting to Instagram
 * - Referenced in SequenceData.performanceVideoUrl / animatedSequenceUrl
