# SPA ROUTING for TKA Scribe
#
# Using adapter-static with fallback: '200.html' for true SPA mode.
# All client-side routes are handled by the 200.html fallback page,
# which loads the SvelteKit app and lets client-side routing take over.
#
# Netlify automatically serves 200.html for any path that doesn't match a file.

# Domain redirects - redirect tkaflowarts.com to tkascribe.com (301 permanent)
https://tkaflowarts.com/*  https://tkascribe.com/:splat  301!
https://www.tkaflowarts.com/*  https://tkascribe.com/:splat  301!

# Catch-all: serve the SPA fallback for all routes
/*  /200.html  200
