# TKA Scribe

**Digital sheet music for flow arts.**

TKA Scribe is browser-based notation software that creates visual diagrams—called _pictographs_—showing movement sequences for dancers and prop artists. Think musical notation, but for physical movement instead of sound.

Built on **The Kinetic Alphabet**, a movement notation system developed by Austen Cloud.

## What's a Pictograph?

A pictograph shows a single moment in a movement sequence:

- **Grid position** — where the prop is located in space
- **Arrows** — direction and type of movement
- **Prop orientation** — rotation angle of the prop
- **Hand assignments** — which hand controls what

String pictographs together beat-by-beat and you have a complete sequence anyone can read and perform.
