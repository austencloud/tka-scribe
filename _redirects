# SPA ROUTING for TKA Scribe
#
# With SSR disabled, the SvelteKit adapter-netlify creates an SSR function that
# serves the client-side shell. All client-side routes should be handled by
# this function, which then allows the SvelteKit client to handle routing.
#
# The catch-all rule at the bottom (added by adapter-netlify) handles all routes:
#   * /.netlify/functions/sveltekit-render 200
#
# File-based routes (/admin, /sequence, /profile, /auth, /test, /api, /landing)
# are also handled by the SvelteKit function.
#
# NO explicit module redirects needed - the SSR function handles everything!
